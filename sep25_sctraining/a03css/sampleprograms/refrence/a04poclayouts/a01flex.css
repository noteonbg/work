  /*

  display: flex;
Enables flexbox layout for the container, making its children (the .box elements) flex items.

flex-wrap: wrap;
Allows the items to wrap onto multiple lines if there's not enough space in a single row.

justify-content: space-between;
Distributes space evenly between items along the main axis (horizontal in this case). The first item aligns to the start, and the last item aligns to the end of the container.

align-items: center;
Vertically centers the items along the cross axis (vertical alignment).

align-content: space-around;
When there are multiple lines (rows), this property distributes space between the rows.

gap: 10px;
Specifies the space between each flex item.

flex: 1 1 200px;
The shorthand for flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis. This means each .box:

Can grow if necessary (flex-grow: 1).
Can shrink if space is constrained (flex-shrink: 1).
Has a base width of 200px (flex-basis: 200px).
box-sizing: border-box;
Ensures that padding and borders are included in the width and height calculations of each .box.
