in your company


git -c http.sslverify=false


step1



1. you got a repository.. and you are going to clone it.
git clone https://github.com/noteonbg/pocrepo.git

created a branch
2. git checkout -b pocbranch

created a file
3. echo hi >> branch.txt

added files
4. git add .

commited messages.
5. git commit -m "file has been renamed"

pushed the branch to the repository
6. git push -u origin pocbranch

imagine data in the repository has changed..
7. come to the branch...
git checkout localbranchname.
git pull origin pocbranch // you will get data from the remote repository
//updated in the branch.

8. then usual stuff, add, commit and push...

9. git diff pocbranch origin/pocbranch

10. to merge data between branches..
git fetch origin
git diff main origin/main   # See what's changed on remote
git merge origin/remotebranch
merge remotebranch with the currentlocal branch.
  
11. to delete a branch
git branch -d branch-name 

----------------------------------

To see merge conflict...
1. change the file local repository and add , commit.
2. change the file in remote repository , add and commit
now try to push from local to remote... it wont work.
you have update local with remote data..
by doing a 
git pull origin branchname.
resolve the conflict.... and get things done.
push the data 
git push -u origin pocbranch
