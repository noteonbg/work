üß© Key Elements Maintained in a Scrum Board:

Most Scrum boards have columns that reflect the status of work items. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs typically maintained:

---
üìã 1. Columns (Workflow Stages)

| Column                                    | Description                                                                                                              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Product Backlog (optional on board) | A list of all desired features, fixes, and tasks (maintained by the Product Owner). Often separate from the Scrum Board. |


| Sprint Backlog                        | Items selected for the current Sprint. These are moved from the Product Backlog during Sprint Planning.                  |

| To Do                                 | Tasks/stories that are planned for the Sprint but not started yet.                                                       |


| In Progress                           | Work that is actively being developed by the team.                                                                       |


| In Review / Testing (optional)      | Tasks waiting for code review or QA testing.                                                                  
           |

| Done                                  | Work that meets the Definition of Done and is complete.                                                              |

 2. Work Items on the Board

Each item is typically represented as a card or ticket. Common types include:

User Stories (e.g., "As a user, I want to...")
Tasks (technical work needed to complete a story)
Bugs (defects to fix)
Spikes (time-boxed research tasks)
Sub-tasks (smaller breakdowns of tasks or stories)

Each card may contain:

 Title/description
 Assignee
 Status
 Priority
 Estimates (story points or hours)
 Comments/attachments
 Links to related tickets or documentation

 3. Optional Metrics & Visuals

Some boards may also include:

Burndown Chart: Shows remaining work over time in the Sprint.
Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits: Controls how many tasks can be in each stage to prevent overload.
Swimlanes: Separate rows to categorize tasks (by team member, feature, or priority).
Labels/Tags: To categorize work (e.g., ‚Äúbackend‚Äù, ‚Äúurgent‚Äù, ‚ÄúQA‚Äù).
