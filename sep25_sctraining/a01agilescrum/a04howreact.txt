 Step-by-Step Planning

 1. Define the Purpose

 Objective: What is the app supposed to do?
 Example: A web dashboard for doctors to monitor patients’ vital signs (heart rate, temperature, blood pressure), medical history, and prescriptions.


 2. Requirements Gathering

 Functional Requirements:

 User Authentication (doctors, nurses)
 Patient listing and search
 Real-time vital sign monitoring
 Patient profile (medical history, allergies, prescriptions)
 Upload/view lab reports
 Notifications for abnormal vitals

 Non-Functional Requirements:

 Security (HIPAA compliance, data encryption)
 Responsive design
 Real-time data (e.g., via WebSockets)
 High performance for large patient lists



 3. Choose the Tech Stack

 Frontend: React (w/ Hooks + Context), React Router
 State Management: Redux Toolkit or Context API
 Backend: Node.js + Express / Django / FastAPI
 Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB
 Real-Time: Socket.IO
 Auth: JWT + OAuth (Google login for hospital systems)
 Styling: Tailwind CSS / Material-UI
 Deployment: Vercel (frontend), AWS/Heroku (backend)

---

 4. Design the Architecture

Use a component-based architecture.

```
App
├── Auth
│   ├── Login
│   └── Register
├── Dashboard
│   ├── PatientList
│   ├── PatientDetails
│   │   ├── VitalsChart
│   │   ├── MedicalHistory
│   │   └── PrescriptionList
├── Notifications
├── Settings
└── NotFound
```

---

 5. Mock the UI (Wireframes)

 Use Figma, Adobe XD, or Pen & Paper.
 Start with simple mockups:

   Login page
   Dashboard with patient cards
   Patient detail page with tabs

---

 6. Set Up the Project

Initialize the project:

bash
npx create-react-app patient-dashboard
cd patient-dashboard
npm install react-router-dom axios tailwindcss


Set up Tailwind, React Router, and Folder Structure (`components/`, `pages/`, `services/`, etc.)


 7. Create an API Plan

Example API Endpoints:

 `GET /api/patients`
 `GET /api/patients/:id`
 `POST /api/login`
 `GET /api/vitals/:patientId`


 8. Implement Features in Sprints

Follow Agile sprints or Kanban board (e.g., Trello or Jira)

Sprint 1: Login & Auth
Sprint 2: Patient list & details
Sprint 3: Real-time vitals with mock data
Sprint 4: Add medical history and prescriptions
Sprint 5: Role-based access, final testing



 9. Testing

 Unit testing with Jest
 Integration testing with React Testing Library
 End-to-end: Cypress


 10. Deploy

 Frontend: Vercel or Netlify
 Backend: AWS EC2 / Heroku
 Use HTTPS and environment variables
