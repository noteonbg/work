During Scrum in a project, teams follow a structured framework to develop products incrementally and iteratively. Scrum is designed for complex projects, especially in software development, and it emphasizes collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement.

  Scrum Process Overview

1. Product Backlog Creation:

   * Maintained by the Product Owner.
   * A prioritized list of features, enhancements, and bug fixes needed in the product.

2. Sprint Planning:

   * A meeting held at the start of each Sprint (usually 1–4 weeks).
   * The Scrum Team decides what backlog items to work on and how to accomplish the work.

3. Sprint:

   * A time-boxed development cycle (commonly 2 weeks).
   * The team builds a potentially shippable product increment.
   * No changes to scope are allowed mid-sprint without team agreement.

4. Daily Scrum (Daily Standup):

   * A 15-minute meeting each day.
   * Each team member answers:

     1. What did I do yesterday?
     2. What will I do today?
     3. Are there any impediments?

     
   * Helps keep the team aligned and detect blockers early.

5. Sprint Review:

   * Held at the end of the Sprint.
   * The team demonstrates the work completed to stakeholders.
   * Feedback is collected to inform future work.

6. Sprint Retrospective:

   * A reflection meeting after the Sprint Review.
   * The team discusses 
   what went well,
    what didn’t, and
     how to improve.

7. Repeat:

   * The next Sprint begins immediately after the previous one ends.

* Definition of Done (DoD): Agreed criteria that must be met for a product increment to be considered complete.
