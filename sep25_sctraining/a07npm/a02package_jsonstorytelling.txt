 `package.json`

#  Purpose:

* Describes your project.
* Declares **direct dependencies** (the packages your project explicitly needs).
* Specifies **scripts**, project metadata, and configuration.

#  Key Characteristics:

| Feature          | Details                                            |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Human-written    | Usually edited manually by developers              |
| Loose versioning | Uses version ranges (e.g. `^1.2.3` or `~1.2.3`)    |
| Project metadata | Includes name, version, license, scripts, etc.     |
| Dependency list  | Only direct dependencies are listed                |
| Portability      | Ensures others know what your project needs to run |

#  Example:

json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node index.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  }
}

  `package-lock.json`

# Purpose:

* **Locks** the full dependency tree (including sub-dependencies) to **exact versions**.
* Ensures consistent installs across different environments or machines.

#  Key Characteristics:

| Feature         | Details                                                 |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-generated  | Created and updated automatically by `npm install`      |
| Exact versions  | Records exact versions of every package and sub-package |
| Faster installs | Optimized install performance                           |
| Reproducibility | Guarantees everyone installs the same dependency tree   |
| Not for editing | You **shouldn't** manually edit this file               |

#  Example Entry:

json
"node_modules/express": {
  "version": "4.18.1",
  "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/express/-/express-4.18.1.tgz",
  "integrity": "sha512-...",
  "dependencies": {
    "accepts": "~1.3.8",
    ...
  }
}

  How They Work Together

| Action              | What happens                                                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Run `npm install`   | Installs based on `package-lock.json` if available            |
| Update a dependency | Changes `package.json` and regenerates `package-lock.json`    |
| Clone and install   | `package-lock.json` ensures exact same versions are installed |
