  "id": 101
}

---------------------------------------------------------

Great! Let's enhance the example by adding custom headers to the HTTP request and then viewing the response headers in Postman.

 Enhanced Example with Headers in Postman

We'll continue using JSONPlaceholder with a POST request.


Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Set Up POST Request

 Method: `POST`
 URL: `https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts`

---

# 2. Add Request Headers

Click the "Headers" tab in Postman, and add the following:

| KEY             | VALUE                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------ |
| Content-Type    | application/json         |
| X-Custom-Header | CustomHeaderValue        |
| Authorization   | Bearer dummy\_token\_123 |

> These are example headers. The API won’t validate them,
 but you’ll see them sent in the request.

---

# 3. Set Request Body

In the "Body" tab → Select raw → Choose JSON.

Paste this:

json
{
  "title": "Header Test Post",
  "body": "Testing custom headers in Postman.",
  "userId": 10
}



# 4. Send the Request

Click Send.


# 5. View Response Headers

After you get a response:

 Scroll down to the "Headers" section of the response.
 You'll see headers like:


Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 83
Connection: keep-alive
X-Powered-By: Express


These are the response headers sent by the server.

🔍 How to Inspect Sent Headers

To see what headers were actually sent:

 Click on the "Console" button (bottom left of Postman).
 You'll see the request details, including:

http
POST /posts HTTP/1.1
Host: jsonplaceholder.typicode.com
X-Custom-Header: CustomHeaderValue
Authorization: Bearer dummy_token_123
Content-Type: application/json
---
