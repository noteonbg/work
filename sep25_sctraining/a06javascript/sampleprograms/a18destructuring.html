    // Array of car objects
    const cars = [
      { brand: "Toyota", year: 2010 },
      { brand: "Honda", year: 2015 },

    // Destructure first two cars from the array
    const [firstCar, secondCar] = cars;


    //we are taking the cars array extracing the first element to the variabe firstcar and secon delement in the array
    //to the variable called secondCar -- doing this is called destructuring..

    


    // Destructure properties from the first car object
    const { brand: firstBrand, year: firstYear } = firstCar;
    const { brand, year } = firstCar;

    // Destructure properties from the second car object
    const { brand: secondBrand, year: secondYear } = secondCar;
    //secondCAr pick up brand property and store it in a variable called secondBrand.
    

    console.log(`First Car: ${firstBrand}, Year: ${firstYear}`);
    console.log(`Second Car: ${secondBrand}, Year: ${secondYear}`);
