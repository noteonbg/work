  //Ok finally some real programs why..
  //array contains objects.
  const cars = [
    { brand: "Toyota", year: 2010 },
    { brand: "Honda", year: 2015 },

  //how do you come to the conclusion that
  //horrible is an object.
  function kidinfant(horrible)

    return horrible.year === 2016;
  }

  console.log("find(): first car from year 2015:", car2015);



  // 3. filter() - returns all elements matching the condition as an array
  const recentCars = cars.filter(car => car.year >= 2018);
  console.log("filter(): cars from 2018 or later:", recentCars);

  // 4. map() - creates a new array by transforming each element
  const carBrands = cars.map(car => car.brand.toUpperCase());
  console.log("map(): array of car brands in uppercase:", carBrands);
